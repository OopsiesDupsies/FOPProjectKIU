1. Sum of First N Numbers:

0 LET N = 10
1 LET sum = 0
2 LET i = 1
3 WHILE i <= N
4 sum = sum + i
5 i = i + 1
6 WEND
7 PRINT sum



2. Factorial:

0 LET N = 5
1 LET fact = 1
2 LET i = 1
3 WHILE i <= N
4 fact = fact * i
5 i = i + 1
6 WEND
7 PRINT fact



3. GCD:

0 LET a = 48
1 LET b = 18
2 WHILE b > 0
3 LET temp = b
4 b = a % b
5 a = temp
6 WEND
7 PRINT a
